    <strong>MATHesis</strong> is a digital tool designed to explore how numbers and mathematical operations were symbolically expressed in ancient Indian and Chinese cultures. Drawing on sources such as Sanskrit word-numerals and Chinese divination systems, this tool allows you to search, compare, and visualize historical terms, meanings, and symbolic associations. It helps uncover hidden structures of knowledge and poetic logic behind premodern mathematical thought.
