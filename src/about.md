    A Tool for Mapping Ancient Mathematical Expressions

    <h2 style="color: #324a5e; font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Project Background</h2>
    <p>
      This project aims to build a dynamic digital platform to explore how numbers and mathematical operations were symbolically expressed in ancient Indian and Chinese traditions.
      Drawing on sources such as Sanskrit word-numerals (<em>bhuṭasaṃkhyā</em>), Chinese calendrical cycles, and divination systems, it creates a multilayered database linking numbers, mathematical operations, and terms with corresponding cultural-symbolic networks.
      The goal is to uncover hidden patterns in word selection and arrangement, and to develop a new model for understanding how mathematical knowledge was constructed, evolved, and transmitted.

    <p>
      Beyond exploration, this platform supports innovative research into cultural patterns of knowledge transmission.
      It aims to enable users to generate poetic renditions of mathematical ideas and proofs following historical literary forms such as Sanskrit meters and Chinese regulated verse.
      By integrating symbolic reasoning and creative cultural practices, the project offers an embodied way to experience mathematical thinking, reviving mathematics as a living part of cultural imagination.

    <h2 style="color: #324a5e; font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Technology and Data Sources</h2>
    <p>
      The project uses a Neo4j graph database to store symbols and their associations.
      It leverages the Eleventy static site generator combined with Vis.js for dynamic web interaction and visualization.
      The data sources include Sanskrit lexicons, Chinese calendrical literature, and other historical texts.
