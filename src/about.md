    <div class="about-lead">
      <p>
        This project is an ongoing digital humanities experiment that explores how numbers and mathematical operations were organised,
        connected, and given meaning in pre-modern Chinese and Sanskrit astral contexts. Rather than treating numbers as abstract values,
        it focuses on how numerical expressions were embedded in symbolic systems, textual structures, and cultural frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project takes early Chinese calendrical materials as its main point of departure, while using selected examples from Sanskrit
        traditions as comparative reference points. Its central concern is how mathematical reasoning was shaped by symbolic correspondences,
        classificatory schemes, and established ways of writing and organising knowledge.

    <h2>Current focus</h2>
    <p>
      At its current stage, the project uses a graph-based data structure to represent relationships between numbers, symbols, and concepts
      to build a relational digital model that links:
    </p>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>numerical values</li>
      <li>mathematical operations</li>
      <li>symbolic associations</li>
      <li>and their textual or conceptual contexts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This makes it possible to trace how symbolic and numerical systems interact across a text and to identify recurring configurations
      that are difficult to grasp through linear reading alone.
    </p>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Future directions</h2>
    <p>In later stages, the project may expand in two directions:</p>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>
        Broader comparison, by incorporating additional texts and traditions to test how well the relational model scales across different
        materials.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creative exploration, including experiments with re-expressing mathematical ideas using historical literary forms, such as metrical or
        structured prose, as a way of reflecting on how mathematical reasoning was experienced and communicated.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These directions remain exploratory and are treated as open possibilities rather than fixed outcomes.</p>

    <p>
      This project is developed and maintained by Lingyue Ma, a graduate researcher working at the intersection of the history of science
      and digital humanities. It is part of an ongoing effort to use digital methods to ask new questions about the structure, transmission,
      and interpretation of mathematical knowledge in historical sources.
